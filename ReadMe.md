## WIFI.CASH p2p CODE CHALLENGE
```
WIFI.CASH peer-to-peer payment app (using in-memory for data-persistence)
```

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
```
Prompt: For this problem we want to write a small piece of the backend
for a peer to peer payment app.

Please note that we want an in memory solution and that we do not need
to implement an actual API.

The functionality that we want for this problem are: adding users to the
app, users depositing money into the app, users sending money to other
app users, users checking their balance in the app, and users transferring
their money out of the app.
 
Please also write unit tests for your solution that ensures all 
functionality as described above are working properly.
